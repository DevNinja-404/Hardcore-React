      <div className="text-center text-xl">
        I am a passionate and dedicated MERN Stack Developer with a strong
        foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and
        Express.js. With hands-on experience in frontend and backend
        development, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web
        applications. Currently, I am working on a Confess App, where I am
        implementing authentication, session management, Zustand state
        management, and user data handling. My project features a modern UI with
        Tailwind CSS, efficient state handling with Redux Toolkit, and seamless
        user experience through dynamic routing and conditional rendering.
        Beyond development, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and have
        been shortlisted among thousands of candidates for a 4-5 month
        cybersecurity course, demonstrating my ability to stand out in
        competitive fields. I am also eager to contribute to open-source
        projects, continuously enhancing my coding skills and collaborating with
        other developers. My learning mindset and problem-solving approach drive
        me to explore new technologies and apply them effectively in my
        projects.
