// React-19 introduces Actions,which are asynchronous functions designed to simplify form submissions.Actions can be utilized on both the client and server sides.

// import Form from "./components/Form";
import ActionState from "./components/ActionState";
import FormStatus from "./components/FormStatus";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* <Form /> */}
      {/* <FormStatus /> */}
      <ActionState />
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
